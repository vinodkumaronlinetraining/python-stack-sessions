# Regular Expressions in Python
- `re.match()` - checks for a match only at the beginning of the string
- `re.search()` - checks for a match anywhere in the string
- `re.findall()` - returns a list of all matches in the string
- `re.sub()` - replaces occurrences of a pattern with a specified replacement string
- `re.split()` - splits a string based on a specified pattern
- `re.fullmatch()` - checks if the entire string matches the pattern

examples of regular expression patterns:
- `\d` - matches any digit (0-9)
- `\w` - matches any alphanumeric character (letters, digits, underscore)
- `\s` - matches any whitespace character (space, tab, newline)
- `\b` - matches a word boundary (the position between a word character and a non-word character)
- `^` - matches the start of the string
- `$` - matches the end of the string
- `[]` - matches any character within the brackets
- `()` - groups a pattern together
- `|` - matches either the pattern before or after the pipe
- `*` - matches 0 or more occurrences of the preceding pattern
- `+` - matches 1 or more occurrences of the preceding pattern
- `?` - matches 0 or 1 occurrence of the preceding pattern
- `{n}` - matches exactly n occurrences of the preceding pattern
- `{n,}` - matches n or more occurrences of the preceding pattern
- `{n,m}` - matches between n and m occurrences of the preceding pattern
- `\` - escapes a special character to match it literally
- `.` - matches any character except a newline
- .* → Any number of characters (including zero).
- `|` - matches either the pattern before or after the pipe
- `-` - matches a range of characters when used inside square brackets
- (?=...) → Positive lookahead. It checks that something exists ahead in the string without including it in the match.
- (?!...) → Negative lookahead. It checks that something does not exist ahead in the string without including it in the match.
